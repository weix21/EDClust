# EDClust:

EDClust is an EM-MM hybrid clustering method tailored to population-scale single cell RNA-seq. Here's a simple example of how EDClust works. EDClust.R is the main script that generates the initial values and calls EDClust function for clustering. Mlung_sub.RData is attached for testing. One might need pre-install dependent R packages such as JuliaCall, SAHRP, and mclust.

An R package for EDClust will be provided soon. All the copyrights are explained by Xin Wei xin.wei@emory.edu from [Dr. Wu's lab](http://www.haowulab.org/).
